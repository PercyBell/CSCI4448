--- About HW#1P#4 ---

- Group: Just me
- Information on running: Should run like any normal python file and output to terminal. There is a bit of code at the bottom that will automatically go through the correct routine as an example.

--- About HW#2P#6 ---

- Group: Just me
- Information of running: I have included two files, a jupyter notebook which can be run if you have the ability to run scala code with jupyter notebooks. Alternitavely you can go to coding.csel.io which should allow you to run scala jupyter notebooks as long as you have a CU account (this is the method I used). I also included a .scala file which should probably be fine to run if you have another way of running scala files. If none of that works then I can run it from my device.
- Things I changed: I didn't change a lot of the code structure but a few little things are different. For example the abstract class is now truely abstract. In my python code you could still technically call a Shape but now in the scala code the compiler will throw an error if you try to. This means I can initilize the methods and data attatched to the class without inputs and then take input only when people call a circle triangle and square. The input is then used to populate that data. This is really more of an effect of using scala vs python.

--- About HW#3 Code ---
- Group: me
- Information on running: Same as with HW#2P#6

--- About HW#6 Zip ---
- Group: me
- The zip contains all of the unity code needed to run the project. It should be runnable from the unity editor (I am using 2018.3.5f1). It can also be built from the unity editor. I tried to upload an executable but it was too large for github to let me. Also it should be noted that the quit button in the game over menu has no functionality because apparently changing that made the zip go from 18MB to 80MB and github couldn't handle that.
