--- About HW#1P#4 ---

- Group: Just me
- Information on running: Should run like any normal python file and output to terminal. There is a bit of code at the bottom that will automatically go through the correct routine as an example.

--- About HW#2P#6 ---

- Group: Just me
- Information of running: I have included two files, a jupyter notebook which can be run if you have the ability to run scala code with jupyter notebooks. Alternitavely you can go to coding.csel.io which should allow you to run scala jupyter notebooks as long as you have a CU account (this is the method I used). I also included a .scala file which should probably be fine to run if you have another way of running scala files. If none of that works then I can run it from my device.
- Things I changed: I didn't change a lot of the code structure but a few little things are different. For example the abstract class is now truely abstract. In my python code you could still technically call a Shape but now in the scala code the compiler will throw an error if you try to. This means I can initilize the methods and data attatched to the class without inputs and then take input only when people call a circle triangle and square. The input is then used to populate that data. This is really more of an effect of using scala vs python.
